# HIV Epidemic Trends Visualization
HIV Epidemic Trends in 12 Sub-Saharan African Countries is a MS Power BI single-screen interactive dashboard that analyzed and compared the trends in 
	HIV epidemic situation across 12 Sub-Saharan African countries with varying Human Development Indexes over 12 years. The dataset was cleaned using Excel and 
  further modifications were applied via the data and model view in Power BI.

# Dashboard
 The dashboard design went through multiple reviews and modifications that would best deliver the objectives.
The display employs enhanced filters, relatable images, slicers, bar charts, line charts, cards, a
filled map, and in-built forecast visuals to communicate the dashboard aim. The design choice
was echoed by the relevance associated with the visuals and best practices.

### One objective result
_**To investigate epidemic control in the selected countries over the years**_:

Epidemic control is reached when the total number of new HIV infections falls below the total
number of deaths from all causes among HIV-infected individuals (PEPFAR, 2017). Cameroon,
Ethiopia, and Senegal reached epidemic control between 2010 â€“ 2021. These countries have low
and medium HDI, with many malnourished persons. However, the countries did not sustain this
achievement as very few infected persons are on treatment, and more people are getting
infected. The trends show a possibility of attaining epidemic control in the future for some
countries, while others are still far away from the goal
